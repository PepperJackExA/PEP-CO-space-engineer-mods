If you're reading this, then you're poking around in my mod files :P

While you are of course welcome and encouraged to look, learn, and take inspiration
(it's how most modders get started after all), keep in mind:
you are expressly forbidden from reusing/reuploading this mod or its assets in ANY way for ANY reason.
(Yes, this includes "server rebalance" etc)

I don't normally mind, but this mod represents an order of magnitude more time and effort than any of my others,
and I do not want it reuploaded.

This mod and its assets are my legal IP, and I will defend it if required.

Feel free, however, to use/modify any of the scripts used by this mod or any of its modules; they are either public scripts by Digi, Meridius_IX / Lucas, and Whiplash141, or were custom-made/altered by me.
